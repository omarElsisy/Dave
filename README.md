# Dave

Dave is a desktop application that aims to measure user’s emotion and heart rate by
taking periodic video samples from user’s webcam. Dave generates analysis reports
containing statistical information on user’s emotion and heart rate in the last period and
notifies the user to take a rest if he looks tired or has abnormal heart rate.
